    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    Welcome to Pipes! An old rusty pipe has broken in a computer lab. Place pipes to prevent a flood
    that will ruin all the computers. You can left click to add a pipe, and right click to rotate a
    pipe that doesn't have water in it. The game is over if the water reaches the end of a open pipe.
    Progress to the next level by connecting the starting pipe to the ending pipe.
